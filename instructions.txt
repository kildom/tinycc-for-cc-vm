MUL Rd, Rr       Standard arithmetic
MUL64 Rd, Rr     Multiply result is 64-bit on Ri:Ro

POP Rd           Pop 32-bit value to register
PUSH8 Rr
PUSH16 Rr
PUSH24 Rr
PUSH32 Rr        Push value from register

CALL Rr          Push BP, push PC, set PC = Rr, set BP = SP
CALL N           Push BP, push PC, set PC = PC + N, set BP = SP
JUMP Rr          set PC = Rr
JUMP N           set PC = PC + N
PROLOGUE N       Assign SP to BP and increase stack by 4*N bytes.
RET N            Assign BP to SP, pop return address, pop BP, pop 4*N bytes.
PUSHBLOCK N, Rd  Increase stack by N bytes and assign SP to Rd register.
POPBLOCK N       Decrease stack by N bytes
